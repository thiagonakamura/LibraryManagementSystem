# 📚 Library Management System  
🚀 A practical Java project to simulate a basic library system using classes, object composition, and simple logic handling.

## 🧠 About the Project  
This application simulates a library system where users can borrow and return books. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in Java, with a focus on class interaction and dynamic list management to model a real-world library scenario.

## ✨ Features  
✅ OOP Concepts Applied:

- **Encapsulation**: Attributes are private and accessed through getters/setters.  
- **Object Composition**: A `Reader` interacts with a shared `Library` and manages their own list of `Books`.

📋 **Interactive Console Input** using `Scanner`  
📦 **Entities Modeled**:

- **Book**: title, author, availability  
- **Library**: holds a list of available books  
- **Reader**: name and personal borrowed book list  

📚 **Dynamic Book List** using `ArrayList<Book>`

🛠️ **Availability Control**: A book can only be borrowed if available and is marked as unavailable until returned.

## 🧰 Technologies Used  
- **Java 17+** (compatible with Java 8+)  
- **Standard Java Libraries**:  
  - `Scanner` – for user input  
  - `ArrayList` – for managing book collections  
  - `System.out` – for console interaction
